The python script will load two csv files,  and then merge them based on a common header,  Then I will drop all the headers I do not need.  After that id the rows that are missing and then print out the missing rows. 

import pandas as pd

# Load both CSV files
df1 = pd.read_csv('file1.csv')
df2 = pd.read_csv('file4-names.csv')

# Merge the dataframes on the common header
merged = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='User ID')

print(merged)

# Drop the columns that are not required
merged = merged.drop(['Bad', 'Good', 'Dude', 'Man'], axis=1)

print(merged)

# Identify the rows that are missing from the merged dataframe
missing_rows = df1[~df1['User ID'].isin(merged['User ID'])]

print('The missing rows are as follows')
print(missing_rows)
